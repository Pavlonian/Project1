            I am currently learning python, web dev(html, css, php, javascript), networking, and ardiuno.
            I am a full time student at Mississippi State, as a junior. I am trying to get into a coop program this year.
            I am a army brat, I have lived a little bit of everywhere and as a consequence I dont feel like I have a home
            in any one place, so I am free to move to any company that I would want to work for. I am eager to learn and
            am quickly becomeing aware how much there is I dont know. This is why I am so eager for a coop program as I
            believe it would vastly improve my knowledge of the world of computor science and IT.</p>
